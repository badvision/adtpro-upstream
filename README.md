Apple Disk Transfer ProDOS (ADTPro) transfers physical disks and disk images between Apple II-era computers and the modern world. It can even get your Apple running if you don't have any disks at all. The host (server) component runs on today's computers with Java, and the 8-bit Apple (client) component runs on any Apple II or Apple /// compatible computer with 64k of memory or more.

The main website for this project is here: http://adtpro.com/

This is a feature branch fork intended to test new features and ideas -- ALPHA QUALITY ONLY.  I am interested in replacing the aged Swing and RXTX libraries in favor of newer replacements such as JavaFX and JSSC.  If I can get this part working then I might dabble in other UI improvements.
