Welcome to ADTPro!

You'll need a couple of things to run the server: first, a Java
you can call from the command line (i.e. "java -version" from the
command line ought to produce something besides complaints from 
your OS). Second, an installation of the rxtx library where your
java lives.  Please unzip and read the INSTALL file from the 
rxtx directory that is part of this distribution.  You will read
where you will need to place a dll (Windows) or library (*nix).

When you run the ADTPro server from the command line:
java -jar ADTPro-0.01.jar
you should see the following information echoed back on your 
console as the GUI is coming up:

	ADTPro Server version 0.01

	RXTX Library: Stable Library
	=========================================
	Native lib Version = RXTX-2.1-7
	Java lib Version   = RXTX-2.1-7

Set your port name, set the speed, and click the "Connect" button.
You should see the following two new lines on the console:

	SerialTransport opening port named COMx at speed 115200.
	SerialTransport initialized.

Transfer the ADTPro-0.01.dsk file to your apple with the original
ADT client (you can use the ADTPro server to send it) and reboot
with the ADTPro client diskette in the Apple's drive.  You're ready
to go!

Please report troubles, bugs, requests for help, etc. on the Help 
forum for ADTPro at SourceForge:

Good luck!
