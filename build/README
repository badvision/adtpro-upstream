Welcome to ADTPro!
------------------

The ADTPro distribution comes as a single .zip file, named
ADTPro-v.r.m.zip. After unpacking the .zip file, you will find:

 * ADTPro-v.r.m.jar - ADTPro server-side software (a Java 
                      .jar file)
 * ADTPro-v.r.m.dsk - ADTPro client-side software (an Apple
                      dos-order disk image)
 * adtpro.bat       - A Windows batch file to start the server
 * adtpro.sh        - A Linux/OSX shell script to start the server
 * DOSADTvrm.dsk    - An enhanced legacy Apple DOS ADT client, 
                      capable of running on both Super Serial 
                      hardware as well as on the IIgs serial 
                      (modem) port
 * LICENSE          - The GNU Public License file
 * README           - The page you're looking at now, mostly
 * rxtx/fixperm.sh  - A script to help OSX server users get 
                      going
 * rxtx/rxtx-2.1-7-bins-r2.zip - A library to help Java see 
                      serial ports.

You'll need a couple of things to run the server.

First, you will need a Java you can call from the command line
(i.e. "java -version" from the command line ought to produce 
something besides complaints). One place to get a downloadable
Java distribution is from Sun Microsystems here:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp

Second, you will need an installation of the rxtx library where
your java lives.  That means the location of your Java jre/jdk
installation; on Windows machines, it might be in a place like
C:\Program Files\IBM\Java142 or
c:\Program Files\Java\jre-version.  Please unzip the file 
rxtx-2.1-7-bins-r2.zip in the rxtx distribution included with 
ADTPro.  You will find install instructions in the file named 
INSTALL when the zip file is unzipped.  An abbreviated set of 
rxtx install instructions are at the end of this file.

When you run the ADTPro server from the command line:
java -jar ADTPro-v.r.m.jar
(where v.r.m represents the release number of ADTPro).
You should see the following information echoed back on your 
console as the GUI is coming up:

	ADTPro Server version v.r.m

	RXTX: Stable Library
	=========================================
	Native lib Version = RXTX-2.1-7
	Java lib Version   = RXTX-2.1-7

Set your port name, set the speed, and click the "Connect" button.
You should see the following line on the console:

	SerialTransport opening port named COMx at speed 115200.

Transfer the ADTPro-v.r.m.dsk file to your apple with the original
ADT client (you can use the ADTPro server to send it) and reboot
your Apple with the new ADTPro client diskette in the disk drive.
You're ready to go!  If you don't have the original ADT, or any 
software at all for your Apple, there's lots of help available.
Start at ADTPro's bootstrapping page
(http://adtpro.sourceforge.net/bootstrap.html).

Please report troubles, bugs, requests for help, etc. on the Help 
forum for ADTPro at SourceForge:

Good luck!

Windows

RXTXcomm.jar goes in \jre\lib\ext (under java)
rxtxSerial.dll goes in \jre\bin

Mac OS X (x86 and ppc)

Copy RXTXcomm.jar into /Library/Java/Extensions. Copy 
librxtxSerial.jnilib into /Library/Java/Extensions. Run fixperm.sh
that is in the Mac_OS_X directory. (Some distributions omitted this

http://adtpro.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/adtpro/adtpro/build/rxtx/fixperm.sh
if it is missing from yours.)  Run it from the Terminal with the 
command "sh fixperm.sh" (without the quotes).

Linux (only x86, x86_64, ia64)

RXTXcomm.jar goes in /jre/lib/ext (under java)
librxtxSerial.so goes in /jre/lib/[machine type] (i386 for instance)
Make sure the user is in group lock or uucp so lockfiles work.
