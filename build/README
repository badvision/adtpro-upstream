Welcome to ADTPro!
------------------

The ADTPro distribution comes as a single file named 
ADTPro-v.r.m with either a .zip (Windows) or a .tar.gz
(Linux/OSX/Solaris) extension. After unpacking the
distribution file, you will find:

 * adtpro.bat       - A Windows server startup batch file
 * adtpro.command   - An OSX server startup command file 
                      (double-clickable)
 * adtpro.sh        - A Linux/Solaris server startup shell script
 * ADTPro-v.r.m.jar - ADTPro server-side software (a Java .jar file)
 * ADTPro-v.r.m.dsk - ADTPro client-side software (an Apple 140K
                      disk image)
 * ADTvrm.dsk       - An enhanced legacy Apple DOS ADT client, 
                      capable of running on both Super Serial 
                      hardware as well as on the IIgs serial (modem)
                      port
 * LICENSE          - The GNU Public License file
 * README           - The page you're looking at now, mostly
 * rxtx/fixperm.command - A command to help OSX users enable the
                      RXTX library
 * rxtx/...         - Library files to help Java see serial ports.

You'll need a couple of things to run the server.

In all cases above, v.r.m is replaced with the version, release 
and modification numbers of the distribution.

First of all, you will need a Java installation you can call from
the command line. This means that if you type the command
"java -version" from a terminal window it ought to produce output
other than complaints. One place to get a downloadable Java
distribution is from Sun Microsystems: Sun JRE download. When you
get there, look for a "Java Runtime Environment (JRE)" download
for your platform and install it.

After downloading the ADTPro distribution file to your desktop,
unpack it using your operating system's native facilities. You can
either run the server startup program from the command line or, in
Windows and OSX, double-click on the icon of the startup program:

Windows:        adtpro.bat
OSX:            adtpro.command
Linux, Solaris: adtpro.sh

You can modify the startup program to suit your environment.
Especially for the Unix variants - it may need a little tweaking to
get the correct native serial library connected.

When starting, you will see the following information echoed back
on your console as the GUI is coming up:

ADTPro Server version v.r.m

RXTX: Stable Library
=========================================
Native lib Version = RXTX-2.1-7
Java lib Version   = RXTX-2.1-7

When the ADTPro GUI comes up, click one of the three connection
buttons to choose your communications type.

If you currently use the DOS ADT program, select the Serial button.
You can transfer the ADTPro-v.r.m.dsk file to your apple using the
DOS ADT client and ADTPro server. Reboot your Apple with the new
ADTPro client diskette in the disk drive and you're ready to go!

If you aren't already using DOS ADT, or if you don't have any
software for your Apple yet, there's lots of help available. Start
at ADTPro's bootstrapping page to get the software transferred to
your Apple.

Please report troubles, bugs, requests for help, etc. on the Help
forum for ADTPro at SourceForge:

Good luck - and have fun!
Unix RXTX Considerations

Mac OSX users should run the fixperm.command script that is in the
rxtx directory. This will correct some permissions to enable the
serial library to work. You will need your administrator password.

For other Unix variants, make sure the user that will be running
ADTPro is in the group lock or uucp so that lockfiles can work.

The adtpro.sh and adtpro.command files can be customized to suit
your environment. The main thing to do is to choose your platform
for RXTX support. You may need to tweak the check for what your
operating system returns from the uname command, and connect that
to the appropriate RXTX library directory.

If you don't specify the right one, or if your platform is
unsupported by RXTX, you will get an error similar to the one below
on startup:

java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Can't find library rxtxSerial
  (librxtxSerial.so) in sun.boot.library.path or java.library.path
sun.boot.library.path=/opt/IBMJava2-142/jre/bin
java.library.path=/opt/IBMJava2-142/jre/bin:
 /opt/IBMJava2-142/jre/bin/classic:/opt/IBMJava2-142/jre/bin:/usr/lib
 thrown while loading gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver

Keep working at your startup script or take a look at the RXTX install
instructions in the rxtx directory. Remember, you can always ask for
help in the ADTPro help forum:
