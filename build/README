Welcome to ADTPro!
------------------

Detailed setup instructions are available on the web:
http://adtpro.sourceforge.net

The ADTPro distribution comes as a single file named
something similar to ADTPro-v.r.m with an extension
particular to the target platform:
 
  * ADTPro-v.r.m.tar.gz - Linux/Solaris
  * ADTPro-v.r.m.dmg - Mac OSX
  * ADTPro-v.r.m.zip - Windows/OS/2
  
After unpacking the distribution file, you will find:

 * adtpro.bat             - A Windows server batch file
 * adtpro.command         - An OSX server startup command
                            file (double-clickable)
 * adtpro.sh              - A Linux/Solaris server startup
                            shell script
 * LICENSE                - The GNU Public License file
 * README                 - The info you're looking at now
 * disks/ADTPro-v.r.m.dsk - ADTPro client-side software
                            (an Apple 140K disk image)
 * disks/ADTSOS-CFIDE-v.r.m.DSK - A disk specifically for 
 	                    Apple /// computers with Rich
 	                    Dreher's Compact Flash board
 * disks/ADTPro-v.r.m.po  - ADTPro client-side software
                            (an Apple 800K disk image)
 * disks/ADTvr.dsk        - An enhanced legacy Apple DOS ADT
                            client, capable of running on the
                            Super Serial hardware, the IIgs
                            serial (modem) port, and the
                            IIc/Laser 128 modem port
 * lib/ADTPro-v.r.m.jar   - ADTPro server-side software
                            (a Java .jar file)
 * lib/rxtx/...           - Java serial library files

In all cases above, v.r.m is replaced with the version, release 
and modification numbers of the current distribution.

To get started, you will need a Java installation you can call
from the host computer's command line. This means that if you type
the command "java -version" from a terminal window it ought to
produce output other than complaints. One place to get a downloadable
Java distribution is from Sun Microsystems: Sun JRE download. When
you get there, look for a "Java Runtime Environment (JRE)" download
for your platform and install it.

After downloading the ADTPro distribution file to your desktop,
unpack it using your operating system's native facilities. You can
either run the server startup program from the command line or, in
Windows and OSX, double-click on the icon of the startup program:

Windows:        adtpro.bat
OSX:            adtpro.command
Linux, Solaris: adtpro.sh

You can modify the startup program to suit your environment.
Especially for the Unix variants - it may need a little tweaking to
get the correct native serial library connected.

When starting, you will see the following information echoed back
on your console as the GUI is coming up:

ADTPro Server version v.r.m

RXTX: Stable Library
=========================================
Native lib Version = RXTX-2.1-7
Java lib Version   = RXTX-2.1-7

When the ADTPro GUI comes up, click one of the three connection
buttons to choose your communications type.

If you currently use the DOS ADT program, select the Serial button.
You can transfer the ADTPro-v.r.m.dsk file to your apple using the
DOS ADT client and ADTPro server. Reboot your Apple with the new
ADTPro client diskette in the disk drive and you're ready to go!

If you aren't already using DOS ADT, or if you don't have any
software for your Apple yet, there's lots of help available. Start
at ADTPro's bootstrapping page to get the software transferred to
your Apple.

Please report troubles, bugs, requests for help, etc. on the Help
forum for ADTPro at SourceForge:

Good luck - and have fun!

Unix RXTX Considerations
------------------------

For Unix variants other than Mac OSX, make sure the user that will
be running ADTPro is in the group lock or uucp so that lockfiles
can work.

The adtpro.sh and adtpro.command files can be customized to suit
your environment. The main thing to do is to choose your platform
for RXTX support. You may need to tweak the check for what your
operating system returns from the uname command, and connect that
to the appropriate RXTX library directory.

If you don't specify the right one, or if your platform is
unsupported by RXTX, you will get an error similar to the one below
on startup:

java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Can't find library rxtxSerial
  (librxtxSerial.so) in sun.boot.library.path or java.library.path
sun.boot.library.path=/opt/IBMJava2-142/jre/bin
java.library.path=/opt/IBMJava2-142/jre/bin:
 /opt/IBMJava2-142/jre/bin/classic:/opt/IBMJava2-142/jre/bin:/usr/lib
 thrown while loading gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver

Keep working at your startup script or take a look at the RXTX install
instructions in the rxtx directory. Remember, you can always ask for
help in the ADTPro help forum:
