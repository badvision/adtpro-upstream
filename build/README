Welcome to ADTPro!
------------------

You'll need a couple of things to run the server.

First, you will need a Java you can call from the command line 
(i.e. "java -version" from the command line ought to produce 
something besides complaints).  You may use downloadable Java
distributions from Sun Microsystems:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp
or from IBM:
(http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/license.do?filename=thinkvantage_en/ibm-java2-jre-ibmpc-142.exe).

Second, you will need an installation of the rxtx library where
your java lives.  That means the location of your Java jre/jdk
installation; on Windows machines, it might be in a place like
C:\Program Files\IBM\Java142 or
c:\Program Files\Java\jre-version.  Please unzip the file 
rxtx-2.1-7-bins-r2.zip in the rxtx distribution included with 
ADTPro.  You will find install instructions in the file named 
INSTALL when the zip file is unzipped.  An abbreviated set of 
rxtx install instructions are at the end of this file.

When you run the ADTPro server from the command line:
java -jar ADTPro-v.r.m.jar
(where v.r.m represents the release number of ADTPro).
You should see the following information echoed back on your 
console as the GUI is coming up:

	ADTPro Server version v.r.m

	RXTX: Stable Library
	=========================================
	Native lib Version = RXTX-2.1-7
	Java lib Version   = RXTX-2.1-7

Set your port name, set the speed, and click the "Connect" button.
You should see the following two new lines on the console:

	SerialTransport opening port named COMx at speed 115200.

Transfer the ADTPro-v.r.m.dsk file to your apple with the original
ADT client (you can use the ADTPro server to send it) and reboot
with the ADTPro client diskette in the Apple's drive.  You're ready
to go!

Please report troubles, bugs, requests for help, etc. on the Help 
forum for ADTPro at SourceForge:

Good luck!
