The assembler I started with is the 'SB Assembler' from
http://www.sbprojects.com.  I like it because it satisfies
a couple of requirements I have:
  1) it lets you imbed/include files so code doesn't
     have to be monolithic
  2) it puts out object code that can be imported into
     a virtual floppy image (with massaging from 
     AppleCommander (http://applecommander.sourceforge.net)
The big downside to the SB Assembler is that it's DOS only.
That gets us through the Windows and OS/2 families of 
operating systems, but doesn't help much beyond that.  If
there is another cross-assembler that runs on more
platforms that can be integrated into the build system
(i.e. we end up with a .dsk with the object code on it)
I'm all for it.

Places where version number is encoded:
	build/build.xml: <property name="versionString" value="v.r.m" />
	client/src/print.asm: MSG01 .as -'v.r.m'
	org/adtpro/resources/messages.properties: Version.0=v.r.m
