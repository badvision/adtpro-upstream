For detailed build instructions, see:
http://adtpro.sourceforge.net/developing.html

The ADTPro project is using the ca65 macro assembler from
the cc65 project (http://www.cc65.org/).  The file
ADTProBuild-default.properties, if copied to
ADTProBuild.properties, serves as a pointer to where the
assembler lives in your installation.

The web site is built using Maven (http://maven.apache.org/).
Go into the doc directory and run the command "mvn site".
The resulting directory rooted at doc/target/site is
the stuff that gets uploaded to sourceforge.

1. Did the boot sector of ADTProBase.dsk change?  If so, be sure to
   re-enable booting on Franklin 1x00 computers.  Bring it up in
   a hex editor and change:
   AD60:4D3B28690BD003
   to:
   AD60:4D3B28690BEAEA
   If PRODOS on the disk changes, it'll lose the Bird's Better Bye
   that's hacked into it.

2. Make sure the version number is updated.  Places where 
   the version number is encoded:
   * build/build.xml: <property name="versionString" value="v.r.m" />
   * build/build.xml: DOS version number, if necessary: <property name="dosVersionString" value="vrm" />
   * doc/removemaven.re: s@v\.r\.m@v.r.m@ig;  <- Note: this one should stay
     at the "current" release level instead of reverting to "v.r.m" because
     it can go into documentation between releases.
   * client/src/dos/adt.s: DOS version number, if necessary: version_no	"v.r"

3. Make sure you've got the latest DOS ADT from the Berlios project;
   ensure the default baud rate is changed to 115k in adt.s:
   * Search for pspeed: and make it 6, not 5
   * Search for svspeed: and make it 6, not 5
   * Search for default: and make the '5' in position 4 be '6'

4. Perform a build
   * Ensure you are using the 'all' target, not 'dev'
   * Ensure your project properties for the Java Compiler are set to 1.4, not 5.0 or above
     to suit our OSX 10.3.x friends

5. Tests:
   * Ensure all files have a current date on the virtual disks
   * Ensure each bootstrap text content works
   * Ensure that floppy formatting works

6. Commit all changes

7. Tag the adtpro project with the version number.
   The standard is:  v_[major]_[minor]_[service]

8. Ungzip/untar the .tar.gz distro on a Mac; delete the non-Mac
   stuff, build a ADTPro-v.r.m.dmg of the ADTPro-v.r.m directory
   (This happens automatically if you just do a regular build on a Mac)  

9. Using the new SourceForge File Release System, navigate to
   the ADTPro project:
   https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/?group_id=170262
   and get to the File Manager:
   https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/explorer.php?group_id=170262
   Expand directories, add a new one for the new release, and upload away.
   Tag each file for the appropriate platform so it is automatically
   presented to visitors looking to download.

10. Upload updated web contents. use SFTP to web.sourceforge.net
    and User name: SFUSER,adtpro
    Files go into /home/groups/a/ad/adtpro/htdocs; back up the 
    old version first (name it the prior version number),
    and move htdocsOLD/archive to htdocs/archive or the A3 library
    will be inaccessible.  WinSCP is an easy Windows GUI to do the
    uploading and movement with.

Need to do a batch renumber of dump files?
/* */
infile = "dump.in"
outfile = "dump.out"
counter = 40192 /* or wherever */
do while lines(infile) > 0
  str = LINEIN(infile)
  counthex = d2x(counter)
  str = counthex || str
  call LINEOUT outfile, str
  counter = counter + 10
end
