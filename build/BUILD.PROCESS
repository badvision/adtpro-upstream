The ADTPro project is using the ca65 macro assembler from
the cc65 project (http://www.cc65.org/).  The build.xml file
will need a pointer to where the assembler lives in your
installation.

The web site is built using Maven (http://maven.apache.org/).
Go into the doc directory and run the command "mvn site".
The resulting directory rooted at doc/target/site is
the stuff that gets uploaded to sourceforge.

1. Make sure the version number is updated.  Places where 
   the version number is encoded:
	* build/build.xml: <property name="versionString" value="v.r.m" />
	* DOS version number, if necessary: <property name="dosVersionString" value="vrm" />
	* client/src/print.asm: MSG01 .as -'v.r.m'
	* org/adtpro/resources/messages.properties: Version.Number=v.r.m
	* org/adtpro/resources/messages.properties: Gui.AboutText=Apple Disk Transfer ProDOS (ADTPro) v.r.m

2. Make sure you've got the latest DOS ADT from the Berlios project;
   ensure the default baud rate is changed to 115k (Search for pspeed:
   and make it 6, not 5; search for default: and make the '5' in position
   4 be '6')

3. Perform a build

4. Tests:
   * Ensure the client can BSAVE itself - and is the right size afterwards
   * Ensure all files have a current date on the virtual disks
   * Ensure each bootstrap text content works

5. Commit all changes

6. Tag adtpro project with the version number.  The
    standard is:  v_[major]_[minor]_[service]

7. Anonymously FTP ADTPro-v.r.m.zip to upload.sourceforge.net, in the incoming directory

8. Release the file

9. Upload updated web contents:
   psftp sf_user@adtpro.sourceforge.net
   cd /home/groups/a/ad/adtpro
   put adtpro.zip (or whatever you call the package)
   (quit)
   putty sf_user@adtpro.sourceforge.net
   cd /home/groups/a/ad/adtpro/htdocs
   unzip ../adtpro.zip (or whatever you call the package)
