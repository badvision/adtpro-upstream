The ADTPro project is using the ca65 macro assembler from
the cc65 project (http://www.cc65.org/).  The build.xml file
will need a pointer to where the assembler lives in your
installation.

1. Make sure the version number is updated.  Places where 
   the version number is encoded:
	*	build/build.xml: <property name="versionString" value="v.r.m" />
	*	client/src/print.asm: MSG01 .as -'v.r.m'
	*	org/adtpro/resources/messages.properties: Version.0=v.r.m
	*	org/adtpro/resources/messages.properties: Gui.7=Apple Disk Transfer ProDOS (ADTPro) v.r.m

2. Tag adtpro project with the version number.  The
    standard is:  v_[major]_[minor]_[service]

3. Perform a build

4. Anonymously FTP ADTPro-v.r.m.zip to upload.sourceforge.net, in the incoming directory

5. Release the file
