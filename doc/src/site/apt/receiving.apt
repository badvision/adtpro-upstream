Receiving Disk Images

 Hitting the "R" key from the main menu lets you enter the name of the disk image
you want to copy from the host to a disk on your Apple:

[images/receive.png]

 You can copy images in any of the following formats:

 * .DSK (Often, but not always, DOS-order images)

 * .DO (DOS order images)

 * .PO (ProDOS order images)

 * .NIB (Nybble-ized images - though ADTPro only writes normal in-track data)

 * .2MG (2IMG images)

[]

 After hitting Return to specify the file name, ADTPro will present you with a
screen to pick a "volume" (a slot/drive combination). The slot and drive
numbers are the first two columns; if the volume happens to be formatted with
ProDOS, its name will appear in the Volume Name column. You can use the arrow
keys or the space bar to pick the volume to be sent to the host:

 The "Blocks" column is the count of ProDOS blocks present on the disk.  Each 
block contains 512 bytes of data.  So, typical disk sizes are:

*-------:-----+
| <<Blocks>> | <<Disk>> |
*-------:-----+
|   127 | 64k RAM disk (128k Apples) |
*-------:-----+
|   280 | 5-1/4" Floppy disk (140k) |
*-------:-----+
|  1600 | 3-1/2" Floppy disk (800k) |
*-------:-----+
| 65535 | 32MB Hard drive |
*-------:-----+

 Some messages may appear in the "Volume name" column to indicate various
situations:

*-------:-----+
| <<Message>> | <<Meaning>> |
*-------:-----+
|  \<NO NAME\> | A DOS 3.3 disk is in the drive (which is ok) |
*-------:-----+
|  \<I/O ERROR\> | Can't read the disk in the drive |
*-------:-----+
|  \<NO DISK\> | No disk is found in the drive |
*-------:-----+

 Once you pick the volume to copy the image to by hitting Return, 
an attempt is made to contact the host:

[images/receiveInit.png]

 If the image size from the host does not match the size of the destination 
volume, you will be alerted to that fact.  You generally don't want to copy 
a differently sized image to a disk drive, but if it happens that you really 
do - you have the option to go ahead and do it anyway:

[images/receiveMismatch.png]

 It will generally be successful as long as the destination has more capacity
than the source (i.e. the host image is smaller than the destination disk at
the Apple).  Some space will be wasted, but it will be entirely usable.

 Once contact is made with the host, the disk information starts receiving and 
writing.  The line across the screen represents a 20k buffer that is alternately
received from the host and written to the disk:

[images/receiving.png]

 When the image has finished receiving from the host, you will see a "Complete" message:

[images/receiveDone.png]

 Pressing any key brings you back to the main ADTPro menu.

 If errors are encountered with receiving or writing blocks, you will see "X"
characters instead of solid blocks:

[images/sendError.png]

 If an image contains at least one "bad" block, an error message will appear both
at the Apple and at the host end.
