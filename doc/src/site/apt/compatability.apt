ADT Compatability

 The compatability of ADTPro and related programs is starting to
 get a little tricky.  A goal of ADTPro is for the server to remain
 compatible with the vast majority of ADT and ADT-derived software
 currently in use.
 Below is some information about what capabilities lie where.

* Related Programs

 First of all, there are several pieces of software that are related in
 various ways.  A quick survey of the major players:
 
*-----:-----:------:------+
 <<Program>> | <<Latest Client Version>> | <<Host Platform>> | <<Notes>>
*-----:-----:------:------+
 ADTPro | 1.0.4 | Linux, OS/2, OSX, Solaris, Windows (Java) | Serial, Uthernet, Audio capable; no nibble/half-track capabilities in client
*-----:-----:------:------+
 ADT (Shipped with ADTPro) | 2.2 | ADTPro | Serial only, client has nibble/half-track capabilities
*-----:-----:------:------+
 ADT (Berlios/standalone) | 1.34 | Windows | Serial only, no serial/half-track
*-----:-----:------:------+
 A2V2 (Shipped with Virtual ][) | 2.1 | OSX | Serial only, client has nibble/half-track capabilities, limited to 19,200bps
*-----:-----:------:------+
 MacADT | 1.21 | Mac OS9 and below (not classic under OSX) | Serial only, no nibble/half-track, limited to 19,200bps
*-----:-----:------:------+

 Generally speaking, the client program (the part that runs on the Apple II)
 for any of these programs is compatible with the ADTPro server.
 Version 1.0.4 of ADTPro started shipping with a new offshoot of the original
 ADT client, based in part on the Berlios 1.34 version and in part on the 
 A2V2-imbedded version.  The result is a superset of all the function that
 came with the latest Berlios ADT client, plus the nascent nibble/halftrack
 extensions from the A2V2 project.  The intent is to have a highly capable client
 that can operate on the Disk II at a very low level as well as provide higher
 level support for generic ProDOS devices.  That work is ongoing, so the landscape
 remains a little "busy" for the time being.

ADT Nibble/Halftrack Usage

 ADT version 2.2, included as <ADT22.DSK> in the ADTPro package, introduces
 nibble and halftrack disk extraction.  Those capabiities are only present in
 the ADT client (i.e. the capability is not in the ADTPro client yet).  
 The ADTPro server 
 is capable of responding to the ADT requests, so in order to experiment with it,
 that is the combination of tools one would use.

* Starting ADT

 Booting the <<<ADT22.DSK>>> disk image brings up the DOS ADT program:

* Sending Disk Images

 From the main ADT screen, hitting the "S" key brings up a send sub-menu:

 From the send sub-menu, you can choose to send normal sector-based images
 (i.e. <<<.dsk>>>, <<<.po>>>) to the server with "S", nibble-based images
 with "N", or half-track-based images with "H".  Selecting "N" brings up
 the Nibble send window, where you enter the name of the nibble image to
 save at the host.  Nibble images should be saved with the file extension
 <<<.nib>>>:

[images/adtsendnib.png]

 Alternatively, selecting "H" brings up the half-track send window, where you
 enter the name of the half-track image to save at the host.  Half-track images,
 usable only with the Virtual ][ emulator, should be saved with the file
 extension <<<.v2d>>>:

[images/adtsendhlf.png]

 The 1.0.4 ADTPro server currently writes incorrect <<<.v2d>>> images - if
 you are going to be working with half-track images, you are best off sticking
 with the A2V2 server for the time being.
