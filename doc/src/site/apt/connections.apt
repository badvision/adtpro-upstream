Connections

 The ADTPro client program comes in three flavors:
{{{connectionsserial.html}serial}},
{{{connectionsethernet.html}ethernet}},
and
{{{connectionsaudio.html#Audio}audio}}.
Each has unique cabling and configuration details.  Note that both the server
and client sides must match in the communications mechanism they use.
